## HW3 - color transfer

HW3 is a program modified from [https://github.com/jrosebr1/color_transfer](https://github.com/jrosebr1/color_transfer)

The most different from our version to original version is the *source* paramater and the *target* paramater. The original version will change the *target* image according to the *source* image. However, we change the *source* image according to the *source* image.
